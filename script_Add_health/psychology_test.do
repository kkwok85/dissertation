* internal consistency access reliability
* Reliability Definition:
* Consistency between two measures of the same thing
* Ratio of true to total variance
* In research, the term reliability means "repeatability" or "consistency".
* A measure is considered reliable if it would give us the same result over and over again (assuming that what we are measuring isn't changing!).

* internal consistency (Cronbachâ€™s alpha) for the scale and possible the average interitem correlation
* Definition of internal consistency: How well are three or more scale items measuring a single underlying characteristic?




* clean missing value first (check with the original missing value of conscientious)
* then do item-reverse
* then do internal consistency test (alpha test)
